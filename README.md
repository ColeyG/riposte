# Riposte

Riposte is an open-source-first game developed as my thesis project for my advancement certificate in Interactive Media Studies at Fanshawe College. The game focuses on being a card game built on a purely javascript stack with node.

## Building

Game:
`npm install` then `npm run start`

Server:
`npm run server-setup` then `npm run server`
